# Getting Cleaning Project

This is the my Final Project
It consists of 4 files:
> **README.md**: this files that explains de others
> **CodeBook.md** - explains the variables generated by run_analysis.R
> **mean_tidy_data.txt** - the generated data by run_analysis.R
> **run_analysis.R** - the files that:
>>1. Download and unzip the files
>>2. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
>>2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
>>3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
>>4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
>>5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
